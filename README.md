# CSharp Basics

## Overview
This project aims to provide a clear understanding of how loops work in C# by showcasing real-world examples. Loops are a fundamental part of programming, enabling repetitive tasks to be automated efficiently. This repository is helpful for beginners learning C# and developers looking for loop examples.

## Features
1. Well-Commented Code Examples: Easy-to-understand C# loop demonstrations.
2. Multiple Loop Types: Covers for, while, do-while, and foreach loops.
3. Real-World Use Cases: Includes practical scenarios like iterating over arrays, collections, and performing calculations.

## Loops Covered
1. For Loop
Executes a block of code a specified number of times.
2. While Loop
Continues execution as long as the condition remains true.
3. Do-While Loop
Executes the code at least once before checking the condition.
4. Foreach Loop
Iterates through elements in a collection or array.

## How to Use
1. Set Up in Unity:
- Create a new Unity project or use an existing one.
- Attach the CountUp script to a GameObject in the scene.
- Drag and drop multiple TextMeshProUGUI objects into the Atext array field via the Unity Inspector.
- Adjust the Speed variable to control how fast the values update.
2. Customization:
- Modify the Speed value to change the rate at which the time value increases.
- Use the loops section in the Update method to experiment with different ways of updating multiple text fields.

## Conclusion
This script demonstrates a variety of core Unity and C# concepts, including arrays, loops, time handling, and working with UI elements using TextMeshPro. It serves as a good starting point for learning and experimenting with these topics in Unity.
